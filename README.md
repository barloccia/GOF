# The Game of Life 

My own version of the John Conway's The Game of Life, written in python.

# History

The game of life is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

Here a simulated version of the game.

# The game of life
### A simple project for course of Human Computer Interaction
The aims of this project are to model the behavior of The game of life, using th MVC paradigm.
This GOF implements below properties:
- [x] A working visual simulation
- [x] start/pause/clear
- [x] Variable framerate
- [x] Drawing/editing of state
- [x] Loading of initial state
- [ ] Zooming/panningof board
- [ ] Cell history


## Getting Started

Make sure you have the prerequisites, see below.
Simply download the code, from terminal move to the directory and then 


```
python3 GOF.py
```

### Prerequisites
